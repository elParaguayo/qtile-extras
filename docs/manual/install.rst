    I have no current intentions to package this on PyPi. This means
    installation may be a bit more "manual" than for other packages.

This is the easiest option as the package is in the AUR. Using your favourite
helper, you just need to download and install the ``qtile-extras-git`` package.

Alternatively, you can download the `PKGBUILD`_ file from the repo and run ``makepkg -sci``.

Everyone else
=============

Clone the repo and run ``python setup.py install``.
