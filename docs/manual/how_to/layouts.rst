Layouts
=======

Modified versions of stock layouts may provide some additional functionality
which benefits from items available in qtile-extras.

To prevent the need for multiple imports, all layouts are available via
qtile-extras. You can therefore use a single import in your config:

.. code:: python

    # from libqtile import layout
    from qtile_extras import layout

To see details of modified layouts, please click
:ref:`here<ref_layouts>`.
