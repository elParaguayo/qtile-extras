    The widget is very simple and, so far, just allows controls for
    volume up, down and mute.

    Volume control is handled by running the appropriate amixer command.
    The widget is updated instantly when volume is changed via this
    code, but will also update on an interval (i.e. it will reflect
    changes to volume made by other programs).

    The widget displays volume level via an icon, bar or both. The icon
    is permanently visible while the bar only displays when the volume
    is changed and will hide after a user-defined period.

    Alternatively, if you select the `popup` mode then no widget will
    appear on the bar and, instead, a small popup will be displayed.

    The layout of the popup can be customised via the `popup_layout` parameter.
    Users should provide a _PopupLayout object. The layout should have at least one
    of the following controls: a PopupSlider named `volume` and a PopupText control
    named `text` as these controls will be updated whenever the volume changes.
